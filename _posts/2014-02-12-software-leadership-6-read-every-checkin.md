One of the first questions I ask when joining a new team is: Where do code reviews
happen?

The answer, and experience of joining in on such reviews, instantly tells you a lot
about a team:

- Is there engineering rigor?
- How open is the team, e.g. is it more of a "closed team" or "everyone is welcome"
kind of place?
- Does the team culture embrace technical debate and discussion?
- Who are the kickass programmers on the team?
- What is the work ethic of the team, e.g. do people checkin around the clock, including
on weekends, or is it just 9-5?
- Related, is the team productive?
- What are we actually building, and how do developers spend their time? Are we moving
in a consistent direction?
- Do people have their own comfort zones, or do developers collaborate across the
whole codebase? What are the specific zones?
- How much energy is spent on writing new code, versus fixing existing code (bugs)?
- Is the environment more of a prototype and learn as you go one, or do checkins
always come with buttoned up design specs?
- Do developers pay attention to things like performance when writing their code,
e.g. do they often cite the results of measurements?
- How are our engineering tools, especially around code reviews and code sharing,
and are they working well?
- How well do individuals communicate their ideas, e.g. are checkin notes terse and
unintelligible, or articulate and thoughtful?

And so very much more.

As a technical leader and manager, code reviews and checkins are literally the heartbeat
of your team. Reading them religiously -- although admittedly time consuming -- is
an absolute requirement for truly understanding what the team is doing and its strengths
and weaknesses. If you're joining a new team, it puts you right at the heart of the
engineering dialogue, and in a position to start fixing whatever is broken (opening
it up, encouraging debate, changing technical direction, etc). When it comes time
to calibration meetings, you'll already have a deep awareness of who's actually getting
stuff done, and who is writing the quality code. You'll see the technical leaders
very visibly, including who is really setting the pace for the rest of the team (coding
output, good feedback, work ethic, etc).

And from time to time, you may even find the opportunity to offer up a small suggestion
yourself. Some might see this as micromanagement, however I've found that developers
sincerely appreciate when their boss or boss's boss or whatever really cares enough
to take the time to understand their work at this level of detail.

There's also the converse of this, which is that it helps to keep the team on its
toes.

I even recommend that other developers on the team go out of their way to read code
reviews and checkins in areas totally unrelated to their day jobs. This helps for
the same reason it helps managers: you can learn from others, understand how the
team operates and the expected level of output amongst different peer groups (or
even those more senior than you), pick up tips and tricks, and so on. Even though
I manage a group focused on a developer platform, you bet I go out of my way to read
changes to device drivers, kernel, filesystem, networking, browser, etc. I always
learn something new.

Now, of course, reading the code doesn't tell you everything. It won't give you a
complete picture of the design and architecture. It won't tell you who is going out
of their way to collaborate with the team and helping others with their designs behind
closed doors. It won't always tell you who is not a team player (although more often
than not it will). It won't tell you whose code is most effective when it lands in
the hands of customers. All of these things are critical, and must not become blind
spots, so you'll need to rely on other data points to supplement the code-oriented
perspective.

But I really do believe that reading code is _the_ most effective way to understand
the inner workings of your team at a very intimate level. And hey, as the hair gets
pointier over time, at least you can fantasize that it is you who is writing it ;-)
So much code, so little time!
